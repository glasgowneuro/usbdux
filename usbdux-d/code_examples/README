USBDUX / www.linux-usb-daq.co.uk

Demo files for USBDUX.

These are example files for:
- single channel acquisition (inp)
- single channel output (outp)
- asynchronous analogue acquisition (cmd)
- digital output (dout)
- PWM on digital out
which have been tested with the USBDUX board and serve
as programming examples for this board.

To compile you need to have "libcomedi-dev" installed. Just select
it in your favourite package manager and install it.
To run the programs you need have "libcomedi" installed.
The kernel drivers should come automatically with the distribution,
for example UBUNTU lucid or later and there is no need to install them.

To compile just type "make".

Detailed description:

inp <channel>
-------------
reads the value from the analogue channel <channel> and prints it in raw
and physical units.

outp <channel> <value>
----------------------
sets the value of the analoge channel <channel> to <value>.
The values are in raw units from 0 to maxdata

outp_loop.sh
------------
is an endless loop which switches the anologue channels 0 to 3
between 0 and 4095

cmd
---
reads 1000 samples at a sampling rate of 1kHz from the analoge
channels 0 - 7 and outputs them to standard out. Additional information
is sent to stderr. By writing "cmd > mydata.dat" 1000 samples
are written to the file mydata at a sampling rate of 1kHz.

cmd_gnuplot.sh
--------------
Uses cmd from above and then plots the data in gnuplot.
The x version of gnuplot needs to be installed.

info
----
Info about the USBDUX board as reported by the driver. Useful
to find out about the range information, maxdata etc.

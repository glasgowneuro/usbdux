These are test-programs for the USBDUXsigma board. They also show
you how to operate the API.

Synchronous analogue in:
./inp <channel> 
reads one ananlogue channel at its max resolution

sh test_inp.sh 
is an endless loop calling "inp 1"


Synchronous analogue out:
./outp <channel> <value>
changes the voltage at <channel> to <value>

sh test_analog.sh
changes all 4 analogue channels in a loop


Asynchronous analogue in:
./cmd 
samples 1000 samples at a rate of 1kHz and writes them to stdout
sh test_cmd.sh
samples 1000 samples from all 16 channels and plots them with gnuplot


Digital in:
./din <channel>
reads one digital channel
sh test_di.sh
reads all channels in a loop


Digital out:
./dout <channel> <value>
sets the bitvalue of one digital channel
sh test_do.sh
changes the digital channels in an endless loop


PWM:
./pwm
Controls PWM from the digital I/O ports. Commandline parameters:
-on/-off : Turn PWM on/off
-freq \t : Adjust frequency
-duty \t : Adjust duty cycle



Requirements:
- comedilib with development libraries / c header files
- gnuplot

Compilation:
just type "make"

Running:
sh test_inp.sh
sh test_output.sh
